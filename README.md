#lwip-on-Kinetis-mcu
Example usage of the lwip stack with a Kinetis mcu from NXP.

Board was designed by me with Kicad 5 and has been manufactured at JLCPCB.com, components bought at Mouser.com
# All soldering was done by hand.

MK64FX512VLL12 was kindly offered by NXP as a sample. Firmware was implemented with KDS_v3 and KSDK_1.3.0
